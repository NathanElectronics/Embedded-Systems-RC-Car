# Embedded RC Car Cybertruck

An embedded systems project featuring a fully wireless RC car and controller system using four ESP32 microcontrollers. The car integrates DC and servo motor control, real-time speed tracking, and Time-of-Flight (TOF) obstacle detection. Communication between modules is handled via ESP-NOW, enabling low-latency, peer-to-peer wireless communication. The remote control features a TFT LCD display that renders both a real-time speedometer and a 2D visual map of the environment ahead of the car.
