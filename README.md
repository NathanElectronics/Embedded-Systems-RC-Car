This project involved the design and implementation of an embedded RC car system utilizing four ESP32 microcontrollers to achieve real-time wireless communication using the ESP-NOW protocol. Two microcontrollers were mounted on the car: the first controlled dual DC motors via a motor driver and measured wheel speed using an infrared sensor with an encoder disk; the second managed steering through servo motors and handled obstacle detection using a Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensor. On the remote control, one microcontroller was responsible for collecting joystick inputs and serving as the central ESP-NOW data hub, while the other interfaced with a touchscreen TFT LCD display. This display featured a real-time speedometer derived from the IR sensor data and a live 2D visual map generated from TOF sensor readings, mimicking LiDAR-style visualization. The system enabled low-latency bidirectional communication, accurate speed tracking, and enhanced environmental awareness, resulting in a responsive and intelligent RC platform.
